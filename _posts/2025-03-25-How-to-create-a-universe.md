Have you ever imagined that someday create a universe of your own in your childhood? Have you ever heared that some scientists on our little blue planet are working on simulating how the universe forms and evolves? And have you realized that you could try to run your own simulation on your PC? This post is actually a guide of making a very very simple cosmological simulation code.

Modern cosmology theory claims that:

The early universe used to have a nearly uniform matter distribution, with very small density fluctuations. Over hundreds of millions of years, gravity amplified these fluctuations: denser regions attracted more matter, while emptier regions lost their material. Dark matter and other components first formed web-like filaments and dense halos. Within these halos, gas collapsed to create stars and galaxies, eventually building today’s cosmic structures – galaxy clusters connected by filaments, separated by vast voids. This process continues as gravity reshapes the universe’s large-scale structure.
