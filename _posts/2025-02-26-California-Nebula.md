Spanning 100 light-years in the constellation Perseus, the California Nebula glows like a celestial silhouette of its namesake state. Its crimson hues are ignited by Xi Persei, a massive blue star whose ultraviolet radiation ionizes hydrogen gas, painting the nebula in the signature red of Hα emission (656 nm).

**SHO (Sulfur-Hydrogen-Oxygen):**
The "Hubble Palette" transforms sulfur (SII, 672 nm) into red, Hα into green, and OIII (500 nm) into blue. This false-color alchemy unveils shockwaves and turbulence invisible to human eyes, exposing the nebula’s violent dance of stellar winds and magnetic fields.

**HOO (Hydrogen-Oxygen-Oxygen):**
By mapping Hα to red and OIII to blue-green, this blend mimics the nebula’s natural glow. The delicate gradients highlight the interplay between hydrogen’s dominance and oxygen’s subtle traces—like cosmic brushstrokes of a stellar forge.
