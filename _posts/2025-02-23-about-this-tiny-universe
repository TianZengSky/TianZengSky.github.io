This is a small world, drifting beyond the great universe (if you’ve read Three Body you’ll get it, haha). It’s a space where I’d share some interesting things I’ve completed or am still working on — like some small practice of astrophysical knowledges, my astrophotography works and some thoughts and emotions of my everyday life.
