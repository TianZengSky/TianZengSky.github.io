This is a photo of the Messier 101 galaxy, taken by me two years ago using the Skywatcher BK 150 and a Nikon D5100 camera on the rooftop of my house. I only had three hours of exposure time, so there is some noise in the image, but I’m happy with the results. It is my first attempt at capturing a galaxy. I can still recall the slightly cold and damp air of that night.

M101 is a beautiful spiral galaxy located about 21 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It's also known as the "Pinwheel Galaxy" due to its spiral shape. The galaxy has a similar structure to our own Milky Way but is much larger, with a lot of star-forming regions. It’s one of the most studied galaxies because of its striking appearance and the way it shows the process of star birth. Despite the noise from my short exposure, you can still make out the swirling arms of M101, which are filled with bright stars and nebulae.

Looking at M101, I can’t help but feel a sense of wonder and awe. It's so far away, that the light from its stars has spent millions of years to reach us, reminding us how vast the universe truly is.
